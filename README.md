# openai_ttsbot

### About
A TTS python program I made last year using the OpenAI API. 
<br/>Untested since I made it, but it probably doesn't work anymore.

### How to setup
1. Generate an API key from the OpenAI dev portal
2. Create a `.env` file and put **OAI_KEY = YOUR_OAI_KEY** (replace **YOUR_OAI_KEY** with the one you generated in step 1)
3. Run `main.py`
